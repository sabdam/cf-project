# cf-project    
CFML Project with HTML    
    
## Cold Fusion    
Cold Fusion was installed on Ubuntu    
Files have been added to the folder: /opt/ColdFusion2021/cfusion/wwwroot    
The browser used path: http://127.0.0.1:8500/login.cfm    
    
## Database    
I used MySQL 8.0.25 DataBase server for Ubuntu    
The script for creating the database, tables and trigger is located in the "db.txt"    
    
## What has not been done    
- Sorting by columns of the table "Bug" is not implemented    
- No id_user assigned on login page (this problem is with this page only)    
- No check for incorrectly entered fields
